## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### 1. Backend Architecture (RAG Pipeline)

```
Documents (.txt files)
    ‚Üì
Text Splitting (LangChain)
    ‚Üì
Embedding Generation (Sentence Transformers)
    ‚Üì
Vector Storage (FAISS Database)
    ‚Üì
FastAPI REST Endpoints
```

- Text Splitter Breaks documents into searchable chunks
- Embeddings Converts text to numerical vectors
- Vector Store FAISS for similarity search
- API Layer FastAPI with CORS support

### 2. Frontend Architecture (Mascot Interface)

```
User Input (SpeechText)
    ‚Üì
STT Processing (Web Speech API)
    ‚Üì
API Call (Fetch to Backend)
    ‚Üì
Response Processing
    ‚Üì
TTS Output + Animation
```

Key Components

### Complete User Interaction Flow

```
[User] ‚Üí [Speech Input] ‚Üí [STT] ‚Üí [API Call] ‚Üí [RAG Processing] ‚Üí [Vector Search] ‚Üí [Response Generation] ‚Üí [Emotion Detection] ‚Üí [API Response] ‚Üí [TTS] ‚Üí [Mascot Animation] ‚Üí [User]
```

### Detailed Step-by-Step Process

1. Input Phase
   - User clicks microphone or types question
   - Speech Recognition converts audio to text
   - Frontend validates and formats input

2. Processing Phase
   - Frontend sends POST request to `query` or `chat` endpoint
   - Backend receives question and processes with RAG pipeline
   - Vector database performs similarity search
   - LangChain retrieves relevant document chunks

3. Generation Phase
   - System generates contextual response
   - Emotion detection analyzes response content
   - Backend returns structured JSON response

4. Output Phase
   - Frontend receives response with text and emotion
   - Mascot facial expression changes based on emotion
   - Text-to-Speech converts response to audio
   - Mouth animation syncs with speech output
